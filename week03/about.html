            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 1995 by two local river guides, RiverRun Adventures started with two rafts and a dream. 
                Our passion for the wild waterways quickly grew a loyal following. Over the decades, we've expanded our fleet 
                and our team, but our core commitment to thrilling, ethical, and sustainable rafting remains the same.
